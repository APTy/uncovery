Privy is a mobile application avalible for the IPhone which allows users to
access our anonymous location based chat network. The key tenets of Privy are
**anonymity**, **simplicity**, and **low barrier to entry**. The purpose of
Privy is to allow users to express ideas with community members in such a way
where they do not feel constrained by their socially defined identity. Privy
allows users to share messages and photos at a paticular location anonymously,
and only users in the same location are able to view that content. All content
is automatically deleted after a set amount of time.
